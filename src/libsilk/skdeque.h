/**
 *  @file
 *
 *    Implementation of a thread-safe, double-ended queue.
 *
 *    This file is part of libsilk-thrd.
 *
 *
 *  A deque maintains a list of void pointers.  It does not know the
 *  contents of these pointers, and as such the deque knows nothing
 *  about the memory management behind them.  A deque never attemps to
 *  copy or free anything behind the pointer.  It is the caller's
 *  responsibility to ensure that an object in a deque is not
 *  free()'ed until the object has been popped from the deque.
 *
 *
 *  Within this header file, the item most-recently pushed is
 *  considered to be "last", and "behind" all the other items, and the
 *  item which would be returned by a pop is considered to be "first",
 *  and "in front of" all the other items.
