/**
 *  @file
 *
 *    Implementation of a memory pool.
 *
 *    This file is part of libsilk.
 *
 *
 *
 *    The memory pool is an efficient way to allocate elements that
 *    all have the same size, the 'element_size'.  When you create the
 *    pool, you specify the number of bytes per element and the number
 *    of elements the pool should allocate at once (internally the
 *    pool calls this a block), that is, the 'elements_per_block'.
 *
 *    The 'elements_per_block' should be large enough to avoid a lot
 *    of calls to malloc()---that is why use are using the memory
 *    pool---but not so large that there is a lot of wasted space.
 *
 *    To use the memory pool, you request an element from the pool and
 *    the pool returns an element to you (the memory in the element is
 *    cleared).  Behind the scenes, the pool may reuse memory or
 *    allocate fresh memory.
 *
 *    When you are finished with the element, return it to the pool
 *    and the pool will reuse it on subsequent requests for memory.
 *    Never "return" memory to a pool that you have created via other
 *    means, and ensure that you return memory to the pool where it
 *    was allocated.
 *
 *    Internally, the pool never uses realloc(), so all existing
 *    pointers remain valid until the pool is destroyed.
 *
 *    The memory used by the pool never decreases; that is, allocated
 *    memory is never freed until the pool is destroyed.
 *

/**
 *    The type of a memory pool.

typedef struct sk_mempool_st sk_mempool_t;


/**
 *    Creates a new memory pool to hand out memory in 'element_size'
 *    pieces.  This should be the size of the item you are creating.
 *    The element_size should be specified with sizeof() to ensure
 *    that structures are properly aligned.
 *
 *    Due to the way the pool maintains freed data, the smallest
 *    element_size that can be used is sizeof(void*).  If a smaller
 *    element size is specified by the caller, internally the memory
 *    pool will use sizeof(void*).
 *
 *    When the pool requires memory, it allocates blocks of memory,
 *    where each block of memory holds 'elements_per_block' items.
 *
 *    This call only allocates the pool itself; this call does not
 *    allocate any elements.
 *
 *    A pointer to the new memory pool is put into the location
 *    specified by 'pool' and 0 is returned.  Returns -1 if either
 *    size value is 0, if the product of the sizes is larger than
 *    UINT32_MAX, or if pool cannot be created due to lack of memory.
