/**
 *  @file
 *
 *    Functions to ease the creation and access of temporary files.
 *
 *    This file is part of libsilk.
 *
 *
 *    skTempFile makes creating and accessing temporary files easier
 *    by allowing the calling application to reference the temporary
 *    files by numeric indexes, where the first temporary file has an
 *    index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and the N'th has an
 *    index of N-1.
 *
 *    The caller uses skTempFileInitialize() to create a new context
 *    object.  This context object must be passed to all other
 *    skTempFile*() functions.
 *
 *    The caller uses skTempFileCreate() to create a new temporary
 *    file and fclose() to close the file.  Alternatively, the caller
 *    can use skTempFileWriteBuffer() to write a buffer into a new
 *    temporary file.  In either case, the file can be re-opened via
 *    skTempFileOpen().
 *
 *    For compressed temporary files, the caller should use
 *    skTempFileCreateStream() to create the stream, skStreamDestroy()
 *    to close and destroy the stream, and skTempFileOpenStream() to
 *    re-open the existing stream.  The helper function
 *    skTempFileWriteBufferStream() writes a buffer of data in a
 *    format readable by skTempFileOpenStream().
 *
 *    The temporary files are not removed until either the
 *    skTempFileRemove() or skTempFileTeardown() functions are
 *    explicitly called.  The user of skTempFiles should add an
 *    atexit() handler and a signal handler that each call
 *    skTempFileTeardown().
 *
 *    Set the SILK_TEMPFILE_DEBUG environment variable to a positive
 *    integer to print debug messages as temp files are created and
 *    removed.
