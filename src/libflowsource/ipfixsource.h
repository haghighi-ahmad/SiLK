 *  ipfixsource.h
 *
 *    The files ipfixsource.c and skipfix.c are tightly coupled, and
 *    together they read IPFIX records and convert them to SiLK flow
 *    records.
 *
 *    This file contains the necessary declarations so those files can
 *    work togehter.
 *
 *    The ipfixsource.c file is primary about setting up and tearing
 *    down the data structures used when processing IPFIX.
 *
 *    The skipfix.c file primarly handles the conversion, and it is
 *    where the reading functions exist.
