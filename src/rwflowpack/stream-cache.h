 *    indexed by the timestamp of the file, the sensor_id, and the
 *    flowtype (class/type) of the data they contain.
 *
 *    Files have individual locks (mutexes) associated with them to
 *    prevent multiple threads from writing to the same stream.  In
 *    addition, the entire cache is locked whenever it is modified.
