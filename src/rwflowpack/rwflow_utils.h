 *
 *    When a file is successfully opened, the function will obtain a

 *    denotes when the daemon is shutting down in the 'shut_down_flag'
 *    argument.  The function will check this variable while obtaining
 *    the write lock.
 *
 *    For existing files opened for append, the file descriptor is
 *    positioned at the end of the file.  For new files, the file
 *    descriptor is at position 0 and the file is empty.
